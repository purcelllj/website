                <p id="aboutpar">
                    Hello! My name is Liam and I am a junior web developer currently living in Vancouver, WA. I am a happy husband to an amazing wife and a lucky daddy to 2 amazing kids!
                    I am a musician and enjoy playing piano, guitar, bass, and drums! Among other things my family and I love to go to the beach and relax. My wife, Ashley and I love grabbing a cup of coffee from <a href="http://www.sleepymonkcoffee.com/">Sleepy Monk</a> and letting the kids play in the sand.
                    Family is the most important thing to me and they are the thing that keeps me motivated.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    On the career side, I have had just about a decade of customer service and sales experience and have always been passionate about tech and about being able to work my way towards that type of career.
                    About a year and half ago I began to study code while working in my retail job. I started with some websites offering free online tutorials for html and css.
                    I decided in 2014 to attend <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/">Portland Code School</a> and took part in their Web-development and Full-stack JavaScript courses.
                    The experience was enriching and exhausting, to say the least. As someone who was brand new to coding, it felt very overwhelming at times and over the 16 weeks I slept very little.
                    Overall, I emerged learning so much about JavaScript and feeling inspired to code more, learn more, and work harder towards my goal.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am currently studying JavaScript frameworks such as Ember.js, Backbone.js, Node.js, Angular.js. I have had some experience in HTML5 and CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap, Mobile-first development, AJAX, Node.js, Express.js, and more.
                    I am interested in learning more about Ruby on Rails and other back-end solutions. My heart is in tech and my dream for some time now has been to become a full-time programmer/software engineer. This has been a huge motivating factor for me to make time for
                    learning and working on projects without neglecting the needs of my family.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    That's a little about me! Check out some projects and non-coding related things below!

                    Outside of coding, one of my greatest passions has always been music. I love playing, writing, and recording music. I am by no means a professional producer,
                    but I find great satisfaction in working on my own recording projects. I use amateur equipment and my macbook. My first recording
                    that I will share was actually recorded without a microphone and using garageband. I consider myself a guitarist, but
                    I also play the piano, bass, drums, and hopefully the cello one of these days.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Here are some of my home recordings. Thanks for listening!

                    <p>This was one of the first songs I ever recorded. It was a song I wrote for my son when he was born in 2008. He was born with some health problems and we were in the hospital for a couple of weeks. I wrote the song because all I wanted to do was to reassure him and comfort him and tell him that it was all going to be okay and that he was safe. As a new dad, this song really came from my heart and despite the poor recording quality (garage band and a computer mic), it means a lot to me.</p>

                    <p>I wrote this song for my wife on our anniversary a few years back. The song is about progressing through our lives together, referring to our marriage as a river. For me it was a way to sing about the beautiful connectivity I feel between me and my wife and how committed we both are throughout the journey.</p>
